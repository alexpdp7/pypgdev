DESCRIPTION

Tools for PostgreSQL database development

pg_docker and pg_docker_psql start and connect to docker PostgreSQL instances,
storing their data in your local filesystem.

DEVELOPMENT

mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 pypgdev
pip install -e .

USAGE

$ pg_docker ...
$ pg_docker_psql ...

TUTORIAL

Start a new database:

$ pg_docker tmp tutorial
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "alex".
...
2017-10-21 10:34:45.713 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections

This will start a new database in a container named tutorial, storing its data
in the tmp folder. The database will run in the foreground until you stop it
with CTRL+C.

If you switch to another console and do:

$ pg_docker_psql tutorial
psql (10.0)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 

You will get a psql instance connected to the tutorial container database.

The database data files are right in your system; you can even cp -a the
folder and start a new identical and independent clone of the database to
try new changes, for instance.
