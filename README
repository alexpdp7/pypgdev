DESCRIPTION

Tools for PostgreSQL database development

pg_docker starts and connects to docker PostgreSQL instances, storing
its data in your local filesystem.

pg_docker_schema_diff gives you a schema diff between two instances' data dirs.

INSTALLATION

We don't have any serious releases of pypgdev. To play around, you can  install
it with pipx:

$ pipx install --spec git+https://github.com/alexpdp7/pypgdev.git pypgdev

Then you should be able to use the pg_docker_* commands.

DEVELOPMENT INSTALLATION

$ git clone git@github.com:alexpdp7/pypgdev.git
$ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 pypgdev
$ pip install -e .

USAGE

$ pg_docker ...

TUTORIAL

Start and connect to a new database:

$ pg_docker tutorial
psql (10.0)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 

The database data files are right in your system in the tutorial
directory; you can even cp -a the folder and start a new identical and
independent clone of the database to try new changes, for instance.

SCHEMA DIFF

$ pg_docker foo
# create table foo ( bar serial primary key );
# \q

$ cp -r foo bar

$ pg_docker bar
# alter table foo add column baz text not null;
# \q

$ pg_docker_schema_diff foo bar
[...]
  CREATE TABLE foo (
!     bar integer NOT NULL
  );
[...]
  CREATE TABLE foo (
!     bar integer NOT NULL,
!     baz text NOT NULL
  );
[...]
